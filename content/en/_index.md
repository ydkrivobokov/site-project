      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My scientific work focuses on interdisciplinary research 
        at the intersection of pop culture and global politics. I am currently 
        conducting in-depth scientific research on the connection between the Labubu phenomenon 
        and the geopolitical processes and structures of the Pentagon.

        Using methods of critical discourse analysis and semiotics, I investigate 
        how vinyl toys become instruments of soft power and cultural 
        influence in international relations. Particular attention is paid to the analysis 
        of hidden narratives and symbolic codes in the design of collectible figures.

        Open to interdisciplinary collaboration with political scientists, cultural experts, 
        and international relations specialists!
