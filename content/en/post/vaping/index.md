Yura Krivobokov, a vaper who has survived hundreds of dry hits and leaking tanks, knows firsthand what it's like to spill a full pod of premium e-liquid in your pocket. That's why he decided to share his hard-earned wisdom about vaping and financial responsibility.

## Why Start Vaping?

Vaping is not just about nicotine delivery; it's your gateway to an expensive hobby. Picture this: you start with a simple pod system to quit smoking, but then you discover rebuildables and suddenly you're spending more on wire and cotton than you ever did on cigarettes. What now? Vaping teaches you electrical engineering and financial planning simultaneously.

## Essential Vaping Commands

Here's the survival kit that saved Yura from countless burnt coils and empty bank accounts:

```bash
prime_coil()        # Avoid instant cotton burn
check_battery()     # Prevent unexpected explosions
adjust_wattage()    # Find the sweet spot
clean_tank()        # Avoid flavor contamination
charge_safely()     # Don't become a news headline
budget_juice()      # Try to save money (impossible)
