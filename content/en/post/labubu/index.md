## The Fatigue of Collecting Absolutely Everything

It happened. A moment of clarity, a collector's paradox, an existential crisis wrapped in vinyl‚Äîcall it what you want, but here I am, completely exhausted‚Ä¶ from buying the same cute monster over and over again.

Day in, day out, I browse online stores, refresh product pages, anxiously await pre-orders, and yet, somehow, despite adding yet another Labubu to the shelf, I feel empty. Aesthetically, emotionally, spiritually. Even my display case looks disappointed in me.

### The Science Behind the Collection Fatigue

Experts would say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just experiencing dopamine depletion,‚Äù or something equally fancy like ‚Äúthe law of diminishing marginal returns applies to cuteness.‚Äù Yeah, sure. But explain to me why my biggest emotional exertion this week was deciding whether to unbox or keep in the box, and I still feel like I just participated in an auction war‚Äîblindfolded, with one hand tied behind my back.

The symptoms?
- A sudden inability to tell Labubu series apart (they all have teeth and mischievous grins‚Ä¶ right?).
- The feeling of wanting to buy another one but not knowing why (classic).
- The crushing realization that I could, theoretically, stop‚Ä¶ but the mere thought of missing a limited edition is exhausting.

### Solutions That Will Probably Not Work

Of course, every seasoned collector and toy influencer would have solutions:
‚úÖ **Focus on one series.** (I focused. Then another collaboration dropped. Didn't help.)
‚úÖ **Sell duplicates.** (I looked at my duplicates. They‚Äôre all the same common ones. Didn't help.)
‚úÖ **Take a break from collecting.** (I lasted three hours. Didn't help. Also, boring.)
‚úÖ **Appreciate what you have.** (I stared at my shelf for 10 minutes. They stared back. Didn't help.)

### The Inevitable Conclusion

The truth is, collecting everything is actually really tiring. A shelf full of toys, it turns out, does not bring endless joy‚Äîit becomes a shrine to compulsive spending and mild regret.

Will I recover? Probably. Will I stop buying the next release? Unlikely. But for now, I will embrace this state of paradoxical exhaustion, stare at my crowded shelves for an undetermined amount of time, and then, with great effort, refresh the store page one more time‚Äîjust in case.
