Yura Krivobokov, a developer who has survived hundreds of failed commits, knows firsthand what it's like to lose two days of work because of a wrong `git reset`. That's why he decided to share his hard-earned wisdom about Git and version control.

## Why Git?

Git is not just a tool; it's your digital safety harness. Picture this: you've written what might be the best code of your life, then you decide to "optimize" it just a bit, and suddenly nothing works. What now? Git lets you travel back in time like a version control wizard.

## Essential Commands

Here's the survival kit that saved Yura from countless nightmares:

```bash
git init   # Start tracking your project
git add .  # Prepare your changes for saving
git commit -m "Progress saved"  # Create a safe checkpoint
git push   # Send your code to the cloud
git pull   # Get the latest updates from teammates  
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # When everything goes wrong
```

## Branching and Merging

Git allows you to create parallel realities in your code:

```bash
git branch feature_x  # Create a new branch
git checkout feature_x  # Switch to it
git merge main  # Merge changes
```

## Conclusion

Git is not just a tool; itâ€™s a philosophy. Use it wisely, and your code will be safe. And if notâ€”just run `git blame` and find the culprit.
